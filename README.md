# Madre-fire-burn-severity-2025
This project uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to map the areas in California affected by the Madre Fire (July 2025). The analysis calculates the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire composites, computes the difference in NBR (dNBR), and classifies burned areas into 5 categories based on severity.
